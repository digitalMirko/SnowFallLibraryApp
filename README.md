# Android SnowFall Library App

App created in Android Studio 3.0.1 and tested on a Genymotion Google Nexus 5X Android Emulator then on a Motorola Moto X Developer Edition Android phone.

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Android SnowFall Library Demo' app icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a full screen image of the city of Chicago and some text below labeled 'Chicago, IL USA'. 
The app automatically starts a snow fall affect which goes over the background image of the city and the text. 
The longer it goes the more snow falls.

The image of the City of Chicago was found on: Pixabay.com and the snowflake clip art used was found on Clipartion.com.

External library used: 'com.github.jetreadarmobile:android-snowfall:1.1.6'
